### Features:

**No-code/Low-code** 

Alerts are processed using declarative, YAML based [workflows](https://docs.dassana.io/docs/how-it-works/low-level#workflows)
The workflows use tiny serverless functions (a.k.a [Dassana Actions](https://contexthub.dassana.io/?explore=actions#explore)) to decorate alerts with context. You can use dozens of open source actions or write your own serverless functions for limitless customization.

**Open Source**

Everything in Dassana is open source. Hack away!

**Cloud Native**

Single click [cloudformation deployment](https://docs.dassana.io/docs/getting-started/installation).

# all of the fields such as csp,service etc emitted by normalization workflow are available.

name: for demo cloud, risk of "demo-service" is low

csp: demo-cloud # note that this value is not used by engine for filtering.
#currently, it is being used to rendering content on https://contexthub.dassana.io/

filters:
    match-type: all
    rules:
      - .csp == "demo-csp" and .service == "demo-service"

#this workflow being a demo workflow doesn't have steps. In general, you will have steps that take the input and output something meaningful
#for example, refer to https://github.com/dassana-io/dassana/blob/main/content/workflows/csp/aws/general-context/general-context.yaml

risk-config:
  default-risk: "" # we recommend that you set the default risk to be empty
  rules:
    - name: low risk for demo-service. In real world, you will refer to steps output
      condition: .service | contains ("demo-service") # jq expression which must return a true or false output
      risk: low # valid values are low, medium, high and critical

output:
  - name: why-is-6-afraid-of-7
    value: "because 7 ate 9"
    value-type: STRING # the field value-type is optional with the default value of JQ. This is a demo workflow so we are not extracting anyting from steps using jq, so we are using STRING which simply puts the value in the JSON key

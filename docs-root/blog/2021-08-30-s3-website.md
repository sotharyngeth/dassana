Welcome to the first entry of the Dassana blog series! This blog series aims to give you the tools, tips, and tricks necessary to operationalize Dassana and **stay alert** ~~fatigued~~.

Today, we will cover an AWS resource that seems to make it into the news quite often. You guessed it, S3 buckets. There have been many cases where S3 buckets containing personally identifiable information (PII) have been public. This is not good.

While public S3 buckets get the stink eye, it's not always a bad thing for them to be public. Lots of static websites are hosted in public S3 buckets; this is by design. This makes it frustrating for security teams to get critical alerts for every public S3 bucket, especially when they are public on purpose.

Let me show you how Dassana can help here.

<!--truncate-->

In my AWS environment, I have gone ahead and created two public buckets:

-   `dassana-blog-customer-data-demo` - This bucket should not have been made public.
-   `dassana-blog-static-site` - This bucket is hosting a static website and was made public on purpose.

:::note

I have AWS Config enabled with alerts showing up in SecurityHub.

:::

In SecurityHub, I get two critical alerts for the AWS Config rule `s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited`:

![S3 Bucket Alerts in SecurityHub](/img/blog/static-s3/securityHubPublicS3.png)

If I click on the `dassana-blog-static-site` finding, here is what I see:

_snipped for readability_

```json title="Static site finding JSON in SecurityHub"

		}
	],
	"Compliance": {

	}
}
```

Note the highlighted area. Dassana has gone ahead and added its context into the finding. As per Dassana, the `dassana-blog-static-site` finding is a low severity alert because of the condition `bucket-has-associated-website`.

Pretty cool, huh? Let me show you what happened behind the scenes. I'm going to fire up the [Dassana workflow editor](https://editor.dassana.io/).

For your API url and key, take a look at this [doc](/docs/guides/workflow-authoring/editor).

For my alert JSON, I entered the finding that AWS Config created via SecurityHub.

Once I hit run, I see something like the following:

![Workflow Editor](/img/blog/static-s3/workflowEditor.png)

Once the alert was sent to Dassana, the AWS Config normalization workflow ran because it could understand how to handle the AWS Config SecurityHub finding. Once the normalization workflow extracted all the required fields, the normalized payload was sent to each contextualization workflow type - [General Context](https://docs.dassana.io/docs/guides/workflow-authoring/general-context), [Resource Context](https://docs.dassana.io/docs/guides/workflow-authoring/resource-context), and [Policy Context](https://docs.dassana.io/docs/guides/workflow-authoring/policy-context).

What's of interest here is the Policy Context workflow. The `policy-context` workflow that was matched was `bucket-has-broad-access-permissions` because of this rule:

```yaml title="Filter conditions for bucket-has-broad-access-permissions policy-context workflow"
filters:
  - vendor: aws-config
    policies:
      - "s3-bucket-blacklisted-actions-prohibited"
      - "s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited"
      - "s3-bucket-public-write-prohibited"
    match-type: any
    rules:
      - .vendorId == "aws-config" and (.vendorPolicy |contains ("s3-bucket-blacklisted-actions-prohibited"))
// highlight-start
      - .vendorId == "aws-config" and (.vendorPolicy |contains ("s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited"))
// highlight-end
      - .vendorId == "aws-config" and (.vendorPolicy |contains ("s3-bucket-public-write-prohibited"))
```

Once this was matched, the magic happened due to the context action that was run (see steps below):

```yaml title="Steps (each one runs a serverless function)"
steps:
    - id: website-info
      uses: WebsiteContext
      with:
          - name: bucketArn
            value: .canonicalId
          - name: awsRegion
            value: .region
```

We ran the `WebsiteContext` step, a serverless function that used the bucket information to check and see if a static website was associated with the S3 bucket. The output of the serverless function yielded:

```json title="Output from WebsiteContext action"
{
	"bucketWebsiteUrl": "dassana-blog-static-site.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
}
```

Now because there is a `bucketWebsiteUrl` available, our risk configuration (below) was able to run the jq-based rules and come up with a risk of `low`:

```yaml title="Risk Config"
risk-config:
    default-risk: critical
    rules:
        - name: bucket-has-associated-website
          condition: ."website-info".bucketWebsiteUrl != null
          risk: low
```

I know we unpacked a lot here. But as you can see, we can start cutting through the noise with a little bit of context. You can take this even further if you'd like to. Say, for example, your company has a standard for how static buckets must be named. Let's say that all static buckets must contain the word "static." You could edit the rules for the risk config to do something like the following:

```yaml title="Sample risk config for organizations with standardized static bucket names"
risk-config:
    default-risk: critical
    rules:
        - name: bucket-has-associated-website-and-name-contains-static
          condition: (.resourceId | contains ("static")) and ."website-info".bucketWebsiteUrl != null
          risk: low
        - name: bucket-has-associated-website
          condition: ."website-info".bucketWebsiteUrl != null
          risk: medium
```

That's it for now, folks. I hope this was helpful. Until next week!

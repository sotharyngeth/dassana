## Documentation Strategy

It is important that we follow a strategy for documentation otherwise documentation, much like product features, tends to become scattered and inconsistent over time.

I propose that we follow this structure of documentation for now and adapt with time:

### Introduction

**Keep this section readable in under two minutes**

This should talk about what problem we solve, a bit about how we solve it, and the benefits of our approach. Try to use abstract, high-level concepts than implementation. For example, instead of saying `AWS Lambda`, use `Serverless Functions`.

### Getting Started

The goal of this section is that readers should be able to deploy Dassana and get a flavor of its value. Think of it like a "hello world" example.

### How it works

This is where we describe the architecture of our product, processing pipeline, etc.

### Content Development

Here we talk about how to write actions and workflows.

### Operations Guide

Talk about how to debug issues, look into logs, upgrade etc.

### Help & Support

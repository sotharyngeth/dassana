# Workflow Editor

In order to edit and create workflows, the best way to do this is via the [Dassana workflow editor](https://editor.dassana.io/).

## Finding API url and key

import ApiUrlAndKey from '../../common-fields/api-url-and-key.md'

<ApiUrlAndKey />

## Alert JSON

If you have your alert JSON handy, simply enter it and hit run!

## Editor

In the editor you will see two major things:

1. The output from the Dassana engine (on the right-hand side). This will give you all the information that the Dassana engine added to your alert based on which workflows were matched and run.
2. You will see the code for the workflows (on the left-hand side) that ran and here you can make edits, run, and finally save as per your needs.

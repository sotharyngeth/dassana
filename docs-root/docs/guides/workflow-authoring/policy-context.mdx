# Policy Context

:::info
It is assumed that you have read the [workflow execution](./execution) page before you start reading this page

Security policies are written using `policy-context` workflows. A single Dassana policy can be mapped to multiple vendor policies.

## Example

Here is an example of an AWS security group policy for SSH from the internet.

```yaml title="content/workflows/csp/aws/service/ec2/resources/security-group/policy-context/sg-is-wide-open.yaml"
schema: 1
type: policy-context

id: security-group-wide-open
name: Security group is wide open
labels:
    - contextualization

csp: aws
service: ec2
resource-type: security-group

class: risk
subclass: config
category: networking
subcategory: firewall

filters:
    - vendor: aws-config
      policies:
          - restricted-ssh
          - restricted-common-ports
          - vpc-default-security-group-closed
      match-type: any
      rules:
          # here normalizerId refers to the normalizer normalizerId which normalized the alert
          - .vendorId == "aws-config" and (.vendorPolicy |contains ("restricted-ssh") )
          - .vendorId == "aws-config" and (.vendorPolicy |contains ("restricted-common-ports"))
          - .vendorId == "aws-config" and (.vendorPolicy |contains ("vpc-default-security-group-closed"))

steps:
    - id: list-of-attached-eni
      uses: WhatEnisAreAttachedToSg
      with:
          - name: canonicalId
            value: .canonicalId

risk-config:
    default-risk: ''
    rules:
        - name: are-enis-attached-to-sg
          #in the below condition, we are checking if the step with id "list-of-attached-eni" has a key with nameed 'result' and its value (array size) has length > 0
          # i.e. we are checking if ENIs are attached to the security group or not
          condition: ."list-of-attached-eni".result| length > 0
          risk: high
```

### `schema`

<Schema />

### `type`

Always `policy-context` for this kind of workflow.

### `id`

<Id />

### `name`

<Name />

### `labels`

<Labels />

### `class`, `subclass`, `category` & `subcategory`

Used to organize security policies. A list of all classes, subclasses, categories, and subcategories can be found [here](https://github.com/dassana-io/dassana/blob/main/content/workflows/policies/policy-classification.yaml).

### `csp`, `service`, & `resource-type`

<ResourceHierarchy />

### `filters`

<Filters />

#### `vendor`

Security vendor name. A complete list of supported vendors can be found [here](https://github.com/dassana-io/dassana/blob/main/content/schemas/vendors/vendor-list.yaml).

:::note

Don't see your security vendor on the list? Learn how to go about adding a security vendor [here](../vendor-setup/adding-vendors).

#### `policies`

List of vendor policy IDs from which map to a Dassana policy. AWS has a policy with the id `restricted-ssh`. In Dassana, the equivalent policy has the id `ssh-from-internet`. This field is used to map AWS Config's `restricted-ssh` policy to Dassana's `ssh-from-internet` policy.

# Low Level Dirty Details

This section is intended for those who want to understand how the engine processes alerts end to end.

## Workflow Execution

To learn _how_ workflows are executed, please read [this](../guides/workflow-authoring/execution) document. The rest of the document describes _what_ do they do.

## Workflows

As we know by now, these are YAML files that tell the engine how to process the alert.
As soon as Dassana receives an alert, the very first workflow that gets run is of type `normalize`.

import Normalization from '../getting-started/concepts/normalization.md'
import GeneralContext from '../getting-started/concepts/general-context.md'
import ResourceContext from '../getting-started/concepts/resource-context.md'
import PolicyContext from '../getting-started/concepts/policy-context.md'

### Normalize workflow

<Normalization />

Visit [content authoring](./guides/workflow-authoring/normalize.mdx) section to learn how to author your own normalizer or edit existing one.

## Context workflows

There are three types of context workflows, and their job is to add context to the alert and use the context to evaluate the risk as defined in their respective `risk-config` field.

### `general-context`

<GeneralContext />

### `resource-context`

<ResourceContext />

### `policy-context`

<PolicyContext />

## Actions

import Action from '../common-fields/actions/about.md'

<Action />

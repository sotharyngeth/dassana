# Under The Hood

Here is the part that you have been waiting for so eagerly. We are finally going to uncover the magic! Under the hood, Dassana has two primary components:

-   engine
-   content

![Engine & Content](/img/how-it-works/engine-content.png)

## Engine

The engine takes an alert JSON object from the inbound queue and runs it against the content. Think of the engine as an orchestrator taking input, running the input against the content, and finally returning output.

## Content

The content is what is responsible for doing the "magic." There are two different constructs within content:

-   workflows
-   actions

The engine runs workflows.
![Workflows](/img/how-it-works/workflows.png)

The workflows run actions.
![Content](/img/how-it-works/content.png)

### Workflows

Workflows are configurable processes written using YAML. There are four types of workflows.

-   normalize
-   general context
-   resource context
-   policy context

The engine first runs the normalize workflow. Then it runs all three context workflows in parallel. Every workflow can have steps that call [actions](#actions).

#### Normalize

import Normalization from '../getting-started/concepts/normalization.md'

<Normalization />

:::info

For more information, view our [normalize workflow docs](/docs/guides/workflow-authoring/normalize).

:::note

If Dassana does not support the security vendor you use, you can add support by following the steps highlighted [here](/docs/guides/vendor-setup/adding-vendors).

:::

#### General Context

import GeneralContext from '../getting-started/concepts/general-context.md'

<GeneralContext />

:::info

To view all the general context workflows supported by Dassana, go [here](https://contexthub.dassana.io/?explore=workflows&workflow=general-context#explore).

#### Resource Context

import ResourceContext from '../getting-started/concepts/resource-context.md'

<ResourceContext />

:::info

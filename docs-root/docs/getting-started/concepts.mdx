# Concepts

This document is a short version of [How it Works](../how-it-works/alert-lifecycle.md) which describes the architecture in greater detail.
We highly recommend familiarization with these concepts. _It won't take more than three minutes (we've timed it)._

## Alerts

You send alerts to Dassana by putting them in a queue (automatically created when you [deploy the cloudformation template](./installation)). As soon as an alert is received, the Dassana engine will process the alert and put it in the outbound queue (also automatically created).

:::note

For certain alert generation vendors (such as AWS SecurityHub), Dassana has native bidirectional integration. You do not have to do anything! The alerts are automatically ingested, processed, and updated in SecurityHub.

:::

An alert is simply a JSON document, and Dassana interprets it using a Normalization workflow (we will get to it in a moment). For now, remember that Dassana can process any valid JSON document.

## Engine

The Dassana engine is a lightweight serverless function that gets triggered when the inbound queue receives an alert. The alert is processed by passing it through the workflows.

### Workflows

Workflows are simple YAML files that tell the engine what to do with the alert. These files have a filter configuration on the top, which tells the engine whether to run it or not. The following workflow types are available:

#### 1. Normalization

import Normalization from './concepts/normalization.md'

<Normalization />

The output of the normalization (csp, service, resource type, resource id etc) is fed to the following three workflow types.

#### 2. General Context

import GeneralContext from './concepts/general-context.md'

<GeneralContext />

#### 3. Resource Context

import ResourceContext from './concepts/resource-context.md'

<ResourceContext />

#### 4. Policy Context

import PolicyContext from './concepts/policy-context.md'

<PolicyContext />

:::info

All context workflows - general-context, resource-context, and policy-context - are run in parallel and hence are exclusive to each other.

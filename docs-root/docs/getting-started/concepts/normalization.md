The key advantage of normalization is that you can process alerts in a vendor-agnostic manner. For example, irrespective of whether the alert was generated by Vendor Foo or Vendor Bar, you can process it in the same way without dealing with vendor-specific alert processing.

This is the first workflow triggered when an alert is received, and its output tells Dassana how to interpret the alert. The interpretation of an alert means figuring out which CSP (Cloud Service Provider - AWS, GCP etc.), Service (EC2, RDS etc.) generated the alert.

Have a look at [AWS Config's normalizer](https://github.com/dassana-io/dassana/blob/main/content/workflows/vendors/security-hub/security-hub.yaml) as an example.

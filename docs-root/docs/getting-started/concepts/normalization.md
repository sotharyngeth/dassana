Normalization helps with processing alerts in a vendor agnostic manner. For example, irrespective of whether the alert was generated by Vendor Foo or Vendor Bar, you can process it in the same way.

This is the first workflow triggered when an alert is received, and its output tells Dassana how to interpret the alert. The interpretation of an alert means figuring out which CSP (Cloud Service Provider - AWS, GCP etc.), Service (EC2, RDS etc.) generated the alert.

The output of this workflow is then sent to `general-context`, `resource-context` and `policy-context` workflows.

Here is an example output of a normalizer workflow-

```json
{
	"csp": "demo-csp",
	"resourceId": "demo-resoureceId",
	"canonicalId": "demo-canonicalId",
	"service": "demo-service",
	"vendorPolicy": "dempo-vendorPolicy",
	"vendorId": "foo-cloud",
	"alertId": "demo-alert-id",
	"resourceContainer": "demo-resourceContainer",
	"region": "demo-region",
	"resourceType": "demo-resourceType"
}
```

All of the fields `csp`, `resourceId`, `canonicalId` etc are available to the downstream (general/resource/policy) workflows and they can refer to the field using JQ expressions.

:::caution
If the `normalize` workflow doesn't run, none of the other downstream workflows will run. So please make sure to review the `filters` section of the `normalize` workflow.

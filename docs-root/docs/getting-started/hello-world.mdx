# Hola World

Let's send an alert to Dassana and see what happens. The best way to test out different alerts and their outputs is by using the [Dassana workflow editor](https://editor.dassana.io/).

## Getting the API url and key

import ApiUrlAndKey from '../common-fields/api-url-and-key.md'

<ApiUrlAndKey />

## Send a test json

To test things out, enter the following JSON:

```json
{
	"foo": "bar"
}
```

and click `Run`.

On the right-hand side panel, you will see the Normalization output as:

```
Dassana couldn't normalize the alert you sent, please verify normalizers filter config
```

What just happened? Why am I seeing this warning?
Did you really expect anything fancier from a foo-bar example json? ü§®

## Send a test alert json

Let's send something interesting this time. Click `Edit Alert JSON` and enter this json this time -

```json
{
	"badThingJustHappened": {
		"description": "fubar"
	}
}
```

This time around you should more in the output panel.

### Normalization

We see a much better result this time! What just happened? Take a look at the workflow file code on the left-hand side panel. You will note the following:

```yaml
filters:
    - match-type: all
      rules:
          - .badThingJustHappened and .badThingJustHappened.description
          - .badThingJustHappened.description | contains ("fubar")
```

Here, we just told Dassana that when JSON path `$.badThingJustHappened.description` `contains` `fubar` (we will get to this in a moment), we want the workflow to run. This workflow performs [normalization](../guides/workflow-authoring/normalize) using the `steps`. We have this step -

```yaml
steps:
    - id: resource-info
      uses: DemoCloudNormalizer
```

What is this step doing? Well, it is simply calling a serverless function named `DemoCloudNormalizer` in the [CFT template](https://github.com/dassana-io/dassana/blob/main/content/pkg/template.yaml#L500) we deployed. You can refer to the [source code](https://github.com/dassana-io/dassana/blob/main/content/actions/demo-cloud-normalizer/src/handler.py) here but it doesn't do anything super interesting but does normalize every single alert to same static data.

### General Context

Next take a look at the output (on the right-hand side) under General Context. You will note a risk of low. On the left-hand panel, click on the General Context tab. You will note the following yaml in the workflow file code:

```yaml
risk-config:
    default-risk: ''
    rules:
        - name: low risk for some account
          condition: |-
              .resourceContainer | contains ("some")
          risk: low
```

:::info

In the workflows of type `general-context`, the `risk-config` tells Dassana the risk of the resource.

:::

Again, the condition here uses JSON rule (yes, yes, we are going to get to it, beerüç∫  with for us for a moment please). The condition here is basically telling Dassana that when the `resourceContainer` contains the word `some`, we want the resource risk to be low.

### Resource and Policy Context

Currently the `demo-cloud` example we use does not have any resource context or policy context workflow so that's why you see this message:

```json
Sorry, but no __________ workflow ran for the given alert. Please check filter config
```

### JSON Rules

:::danger

G to add readme + examples for rule engine

:::

JSON rules are the standardized way in Dassana to filter things. We have open-sourced our [rule engine](https://github.com/dassana-io/rule-engine) which takes a JSON input, a JSON rule and returns `true` or `false` based upon the json rule evaluation.

We recommend you checkout [examples](https://github.com/dassana-io/rule-engine/blob/main/README.md#examples) to get a flavor of how these rules work.

## What's next?

Checkout some of the [vendor integrations](../guides/vendor-setup/aws-config/setup.md) to process some real alerts this time. Or, if you're hungry, order a pizza üçï with pineapple üçç

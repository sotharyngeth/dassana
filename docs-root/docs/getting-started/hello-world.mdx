# Hola World

Let's send an alert to Dassana and see what happens. The best way to test out different alerts and their outputs is by using the [Dassana workflow editor](https://editor.dassana.io/).

## Getting the API url and key

import ApiUrlAndKey from '../common-fields/api-url-and-key.md'

<ApiUrlAndKey />

## Send a test json

To test things out, enter the following JSON:

```json
{
	"foo": "bar"
}
```

and click `Run`.

On the right-hand side panel, you will see the Normalization output as:

```
Dassana couldn't normalize the alert you sent, please verify normalizers filter config
```

What just happened? Why am I seeing this warning?
Did you really expect anything fancier from a foo-bar example json? ü§®

## Send a test alert json

Let's send something interesting this time. Click `Edit Alert JSON` and enter this json this time -

```json
{
	"badThingJustHappened": {
		"description": "fubar"
	}
}
```

This time around you should more in the output panel.

### Normalization

We see a much better result this time! What just happened? Take a look at the workflow file code on the left-hand side panel. You will note the following:

```yaml
filters:
    - match-type: all
      rules:
          - .badThingJustHappened and .badThingJustHappened.description
          - .badThingJustHappened.description | contains ("fubar")
```

Here, we just told Dassana that when JQ expressions `.badThingJustHappened and .badThingJustHappened.description` and `.badThingJustHappened.description | contains ("fubar")` evaluate to true
(we will get to this in a moment), we want the workflow to run.

### General Context

Next take a look at the output (on the right-hand side) under General Context. You will note a risk of low. On the left-hand panel, click on the General Context tab. You will note the following yaml in the workflow file code:

```yaml
risk-config:
    default-risk: '' # we recommend that you set the default risk to be empty
    rules:
        - name: low risk for demo-service
          condition: .service | contains ("demo-service") # jq expression which must return a true or false output
          risk: low # valid values are low, medium, high and critical
```

In general (no pun intended), the general context is intended to provide context on a highest level. For example, for alerts generated against AWS resources,
the general context can provide context about the account in question, the AWS org, tags etc.

:::info

In the workflows of type `general-context`, `resource-context` and `policy-context`, the `risk-config` section is used to represent the risk associated with
the respective workflow type. The `normalize` workflow type does not have any risk config.
:::

Again, the condition here uses JQ rules (yes, yes, we are going to get to it, beerüç∫ with for us for a moment please).
The condition here is basically telling Dassana that when the `service` contains the word `demo-service`, we want the resource risk to be low.

### Resource Context

The workflows of `resource-context` are intended to provide context around the resource. These workflows should _not_ care about the alert actually.
For example, refer to [ec2-instance-context](https://github.com/dassana-io/dassana/blob/main/content/workflows/csp/aws/service/ec2/resources/instance/resource-context/instance-context.yaml) workflow.
That workflow calls an action [WhatIsEc2Exposure](https://github.com/dassana-io/dassana/tree/main/content/actions/what-is-exposure-of-ec2-instance) in the steps
to provide context around exposure of an ec2 instance.

:::tip

You can directly run a workflow if you want. This makes `resource-context` workflow quite powerful. For example,
given an ec2 instance arn, you can just run the following curl command and run the workflow directly and get context about its exposure.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://<rest-api-id>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/run?workflowId=ec2-instance-context&includeStepOutput=true' \
--header 'x-api-key: <YOUR-API-KEY-GOES-HERE>' \
--data-raw '{
  "instanceArn": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/i-09f3989e7c911111"
}'

```

Here, we are bypassing normalizatio, general context etc and running a workflow directly.
This makes it super easy to get context directly of a resource

:::

### Policy Context

The workflows of `policy-context` are intended to provide context around the alert. These workflows should care about the alert actually (as opposed to resource-context workflows which should care about the resource in question)
For example, refer to [bucket-has-broad-access-permissions](https://github.com/dassana-io/dassana/blob/main/content/workflows/csp/aws/service/s3/resources/bucket/policy-context/bucket-has-broad-access-permissions.yaml) workflow.
That workflow calls an action [WebsiteContext](https://github.com/dassana-io/dassana/tree/main/content/actions/website-context) in the steps to find out if bucket in question has an associated website with it or not.

### JQ rules

JQ is widely used in Dassana. It is used in `filters` section of the workflow to find out if the workflow should run or not.
It is also used to extract values from JSON. We highly recommend that you familiarize yourself with JQ. Here is a [tutorial](https://earthly.dev/blog/jq-select/) to get you started.
You can also test JQ expressions [here](https://jqplay.org/).

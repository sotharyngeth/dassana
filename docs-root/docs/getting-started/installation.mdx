###### `CrossAccountRoleName`

If you would like Dassana to process alerts belonging to other AWS accounts (i.e. you are deploying Dassana in a "central" account), enter the name of the role that the Dassana engine will assume.
For more information, refer to [cross account role section](./aws-cross-account-role).
